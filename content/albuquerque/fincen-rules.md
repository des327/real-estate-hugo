**Critical Update for Cash Investors**

Big changes are coming to real estate closings in New Mexico. **Effective March 1, 2026**, FinCEN is implementing new reporting rules to crack down on anonymous buying.

### The 4-Part Test
Your transaction must be reported if it meets **ALL** of these criteria:
1.  **Residential Property:** Single-family, condo, or land for housing.
2.  **Non-Financed (Cash):** No mortgage involved.
3.  **Entity Buyer:** Purchasing under an LLC, Trust, or Corporation.
4.  **No Exemptions:** Does not fall under specific regulated bank exclusions.

**What this means:** Title companies will now be required to report the *beneficial owners* (the actual humans) behind the LLC to the federal government.
